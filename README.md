# Relaxer Breathing App

The Relaxer Breathing App visually guides the user through an unlimited number of breath cycles. The circle increases in size, holds, and decreases in size to prompt the user. The timer function assists the user in knowing how much time each segment requires.

JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are used.
