# Inhala y Exhala Breathing App

Take a breath or two and see it in action at [Inhala y Exhala App](https://jssckbl.github.io/relaxer-app/).

The Inhala y Exhala Breathing App visually guides the user through an unlimited number of breath cycles. The circle increases in size for about 5 seconds, holds for 3 seconds, and decreases in size for another 5 seconds. The circle dynamically responds to each of the 3 stages. The white dot moving around the circumference also provides a visual queue for the user.

A full cycle will take just over 13 seconds.

JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are used.

Images below show the three stages. Image is in
